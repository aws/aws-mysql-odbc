# Amazon Web Services (AWS) ODBC Driver for MySQL

**The Amazon Web Services (AWS) ODBC Driver for MySQL** allows an application to take advantage of the features of clustered MySQL databases. It is based on and can be used as a drop-in compatible for the [MySQL Connector/ODBC driver](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-odbc/), and is compatible with all MySQL deployments.

## What is Failover?
An Amazon Aurora database (DB) cluster uses failover to automatically repair the DB cluster status when a primary DB instance becomes unavailable. During failover, Aurora promotes a replica to become the new primary DB instance, so that the DB cluster can provide maximum availability to a primary read-write DB instance. The AWS ODBC Driver for MySQL is designed to coordinate with this behaviour in order to provide minimal downtime in the event of a DB instance failure.

## Benefits of the AWS ODBC Driver for MySQL
Although Aurora is able to provide maximum availability through the use of failover, existing client drivers do not fully support this functionality. This is partially due to the time required for the DNS of the new primary DB instance to be fully resolved in order to properly direct the connection. The AWS ODBC Driver for MySQL fully utilizes failover behaviour by maintaining a cache of the Aurora cluster topology and each DB instance's role (Aurora Replica or primary DB instance). This topology is provided via a direct query to the Aurora database, essentially providing a shortcut to bypass the delays caused by DNS resolution. With this knowledge, the AWS ODBC Driver can more closely monitor the Aurora DB cluster status so that a connection to the new primary DB instance can be established as fast as possible. Additionally, as noted above, the AWS ODBC Driver is designed to be drop-in compatible for other MySQL ODBC drivers and can be used to interact with Aurora MySQL, RDS MySQL, and commercial/open-source MySQL databases.

## Getting Started
