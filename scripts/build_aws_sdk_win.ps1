This script is to assist with building the driver and creating the installer. There are two optional arguments:
- $CONFIGURATION: determines what configuration you would like to build the driver in (Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo)
- $MYSQL_DIR: determines where your MySQL installation is located

The current default behaviour is to build the driver and installer without unit or integration tests on the Release configuration, 
with "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0" set as the location of the MySQL directory

Note that building the installer requires the following:
- Wix 3.0 or above (https://wixtoolset.org/)
- Microsoft Visual Studio environment
- CMake 2.4.6 (http://www.cmake.org)
