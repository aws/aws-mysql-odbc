This script is to assist with building the driver and creating the installer. There are two optional arguments:
- $CONFIGURATION: determines what configuration you would like to build the driver in (Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo)
- $MYSQL_DIR: determines where your MySQL installation is located

The current default behaviour is to build the driver and installer without unit or integration tests on the Release configuration, 
with "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0" set as the location of the MySQL directory

Note that building the installer requires the following:
- Wix 3.0 or above (https://wixtoolset.org/)
- Microsoft Visual Studio environment
- CMake 2.4.6 (http://www.cmake.org)
#>

$CONFIGURATION = $args[0]
$MYSQL_DIR = $args[1]

# Set default values
if ($null -eq $CONFIGURATION) {
    $CONFIGURATION = "Release"
}
if ($null -eq $MYSQL_DIR) {
    $MYSQL_DIR = "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0"
}

# BUILD DRIVER
cmake -S . -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -DMYSQL_DIR=$MYSQL_DIR -DMYSQLCLIENT_STATIC_LINKING=TRUE
cmake --build . --config $CONFIGURATION
